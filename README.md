# System-Update-Notifier
This code was created for lazy people who don't work to do many actions :)
## Notes
- You need to replace ```your_email``` with your email address.
- You need to replace ```your_gmail_username``` and ```your_gmail_password``` with the username and password of your Gmail account.
## How to use
1. Save the code in a Python file.
2. Run the file using the following command:
```py
python check_updates.py
```
3. The code will check if there are updates available.
4. If updates are available, the code will send you an email with a list of updates and instructions on how to install them.
## Possible extensions
- You can add an additional condition that checks the operating system version and sends an alert only if the version is outdated.
- You can add an option to choose which updates to install and which not to install.
- You can configure the code to automatically alert about available updates every day or week.
  ## Additional notes
  - This code is a simple example and can be improved according to your needs.
  - It is important to make sure that the code works properly before using it regularly.

I hope this helps!
